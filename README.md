# Astrobiology

This is a rather new field of study and brings together scientists from a lot of areas including: astronomy, biology, physics, geology, etc. They all work together to try to understand the history of a planet and whether there is the potential for life to exist outside of our Earth.

Mars has many areas that show that the planet probably had water around 3.5 billion years ago. The evidence indicates that Mars might have had some of the largest floods of any planet in the solar system. The current temperatures on Mars are too cold and, combined with the thin atmosphere, liquid water can’t exist on the surface for very long. There is water that is close to the surface and frozen at the polar ice caps, however, the sheer volume of water that is required to carve out the huge channels and flood plains isn’t on the surface today.

Mars Global Surveyor has sent back images that suggest that there may be reservoirs of water underground and that they break the surface at intervals. If this is true, liquid water underground might also be harboring life.

Figuring out if there is liquid water on Mars is one of the most important factors to understanding everything about Mars as well as unlocking some of the secrets of the evolution of other planets, including Earth. Before any humans visit and stay on Mars we need to know everything that we can about the environment, especially if there is a resource such as water available.

With the discovery of possible fossil life in the Mars meteorite, ALH84001, the interest in Mars increased so that  formed their Astrobiology Program and the Astrobiology Institute. During this same time, the  Mars Exploration Program focused on the data being sent by the various rover missions. The information that was being studied included the search for potential water on Mars as well as the mineral ingredients held within the rocks to see if they ever hosted life.

Has shifted their science them so that they are seeking for signs of life on Mars. The details are held in the rocks at incredibly small levels. Compounds that are called biosignatures that are molecular fossils can indicate if organisms created them. The difficulty with the rocks on Mars is that they are subject to destruction and transformation over hundreds of millions of years and the signatures may not be recognizable.

One of the plans for future missions is to locate places on the surface where the wind-blown erosion has exposed more ancient material. The plan will include the ExoMars rover which will drill and take samples from a depth of around two meters for analysis.

The atmosphere on Mars is a lot thinner than the atmosphere on Earth. It’s mainly made up of 96% carbon dioxide, and smaller percentages of other gases such as nitrogen and argon. Although the atmosphere is thin, the atmospheric pressure on Mars’ surface is around 0.6 percent of that at sea level on Earth.
